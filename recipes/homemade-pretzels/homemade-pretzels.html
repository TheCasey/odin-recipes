    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade pretzels are a delicious and fun snack that you can make from scratch. They are soft, chewy, and can be topped with coarse salt or your favorite seasonings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F or 45째C)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup baking soda</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt (for topping)</li>
        <li>1 egg (beaten, for egg wash)</li>
        <li>Optional toppings (e.g., garlic powder, onion powder, sesame seeds)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Add flour and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450째F (232째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 10 cups of water to a boil. Add baking soda to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope and shape it into a pretzel.</li>
        <li>Carefully place each pretzel into the boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Brush each pretzel with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sea salt and any optional toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your homemade pretzels!</li>
